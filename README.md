# CPU-cache-system
CPU-cache-system made with Haskell
in this project i present  successful implementation of a simplified CPU cache system that works by retrieving data (from cache if possible, otherwise from memory)
given the memory addresses of the data and successfully updating the cache upon the data retrieval.

in this project there are  3 types of cache mapping techniques: Direct mapping, fully
associative and set associative
